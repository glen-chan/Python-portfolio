# Python-portfolio

This is my very first python scripting project =)

The idea is to transform a .pdf file to mp3. 

To run it you need to install pyttsx3 and PyPDF2. The script receives two arguments: the name of the .pdf file to read and the name of the .mp3 to generate. If you don't add an output name it will by default generate a .mp3 with the same name of the .pdf.

This is an example of how you should run it:
main_pdf_to_audio.py --pdf Zelda.pdf --mp3 Zelda.mp3
